<h1> A Sweet Scent in the Air</h1>
<h2>
Marissa Zappas, a perfumer based in Brooklyn, New York, is currently serving as a year-long-artist-in-residence at the Elsewhere music venue in Bushwick. As part of the residency, each season of the year she is scenting a space in the venue. Her first scent was done during the summer, and it was called Cartouche. Her second scent, for the fall, will make its debut on October 22nd.</h2>

		Zappas worked on a scent for an exhibition that is set to launch October 22nd. It will feature smells such as jasmine and myrrh. She is the first person to serve as an artist-in-residence at the venue. “For me, smell and creating perfume has always been kind of an art, and so I wanted to find a project that was interested in kind of exploring that, and not just implementing your normal sort of freshening smells, and doing something a little bit different,” Zappas says.

		The art gallery at Elsewhere is unique, as it is above the music venue. Mollly Surno serves as the director of the gallery. "We're creating this sort of visual wonderland for people that maybe didn't even know they had an opinion or cared about a particular kind of artwork, and we're giving them an oppurtunity to do so," says Surno.

		The shows at the art gallery are actually subsidized through the club's music ticket sales. Surno says that often times, whenever people tag Elsewhere on social media, they also include photos of themselves around the artwork in the venue.
